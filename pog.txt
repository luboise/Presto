To check edge collision in 2d





- Project the cylinder to a circle (x^2 + y^2 <= r)
	- No need to actually project it, we can just create a new circle on XZ plane (view from above)
- Project the triangle to the circles space
- For each edge
	 - Check if the edge collides
- If none collide
	- No collision 

// From this point onwards, we can assume the triangle MIGHT have collided

- Project the triangle to the front view of the cylinder (rectangle view)
	- In order to do this
	- if check, then return true
- Project the triangle to the side view of the cylinder (side rectangle view)
	- if check, then return true

// The triangle didnt cross it from the side at all, which means the top check didn't actually cross it

return false
